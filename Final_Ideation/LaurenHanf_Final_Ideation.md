For my final project I would like to iterate on my Paseo project and my hydroponics project. I would like to either create a larger scale project using the potterbot, or create mockups of a larger scale public hydroponic artwork. 

I could 3d print smaller scale versions of the areas I would like to retrofit or the parts I would like the add to the area to reimagine it. Ideally I would like to have the 3d printed mockups interact with a Unity 3D project via NFC or RFID, much like a Skylanders portal. Ideally the reading surface would show a top view of the scene in Unity, with the objects removed. An iPad or Wii U game pad could be useful to build with. 

At the same time the objects would be displayed in situ in a VR headspace. Changing the object on the portal could change the scene being shown.
