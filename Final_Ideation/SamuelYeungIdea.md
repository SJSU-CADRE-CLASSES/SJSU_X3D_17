For my final project, I want to create a scene from a dream. The ruins of an old church are surrounded by a fog covered forest. Nearby a stream trickles and mountains can be seen surrounding the area. Bright sunlight shines through a broken window at the back of the church, creating a beam which reflects off a fountain inside. The walls are covered in moss and weathered chunks are laying around the area. Rows of stone pews wait for the congregation that never returned.
