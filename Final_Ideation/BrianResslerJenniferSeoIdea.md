For our proposal, we were initially thinking of addressing the issue of surveillance.  But then came the idea that perhaps we can use live data from social media sites to give a unique perspective on the manner.  Assuming that we can figure out hot live stream data in unity from an api we would like to show a space where this data is flowing around in an environment which represents digital space.  We would also like to have interactive elements such as the floor being able to show screens of different social media sites as well as the floating data itself being touchable and somehow reacting.
For the overall aesthetic, we were thinking some sort of dark neon light environment.  This will give the impression of the user being some sort of observer of the data, almost like being a spy.
