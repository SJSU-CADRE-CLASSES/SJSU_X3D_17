When I was little, I lives in a house that had a tall fence around its backyard, and right behind my house beyond the fence was this hug pine tree. Because of the tree and the tall fence, I always wondered what was on the other side of the fence. Several times, I imagined what could be on the other side and other times, I would end up dream about it. For this final project, I had the idea of making a kind of model of that backyard with a tall fence. Then on the other side of that fence, I can make models of what I imagined or dreamed what was on the other side of the fence. The concept of this could be dream and reality, but the story of my childhood is a good narrative for the project as well.
