<p>For my final ideation, my concept is the meaning of being human. I have four spiral sections that respresent what it means to be human to me. On each section there are varying images that depict Emotion, Love, Life, Mind/Body/Spirit. It is a VR installation where the player can travel through the spirals and view all the images and think to themselves what being human means to them. <p/>
