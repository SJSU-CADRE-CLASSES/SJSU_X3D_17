<h2>Final Project : Dark Tower </h2>
<br>

<center>
<p>For my project, I wanted to create a VR scene inspired by Stephen King’s Dark Tower series. When I read the first book, The Gunslinger, I was impressed about the world building in the series. In response, I decide to build a section of how I imagine King’s environment. The dark tower is a mysterious tall mountain, a pinnacle of the universe. The book combined  science fiction and western themes. The main character, Roland, is on a quest to the tower throughout a vast desert. Although the world is apocalyptic, I wanted to convey there was still some life in the wasteland. I decided to do the opposite of the grim scenes the Dark Tower depicts. The dark tower still stands in the middle of the desert, but it still has an atmosphere of mystery.I sculpted everything in Maya. I added textures and shaders in Unity. In the space, I wanted the viewer to sense how serene the desert is. It is serene until they notice the dark rock sitting in the middle. And wanted it to peak curiosity where the viewer looks up to realize it is a looming tower.
