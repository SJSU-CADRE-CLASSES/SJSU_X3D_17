# invisible illness: Narcolepsy

Invisible illness is conceptual mixed media artwork that incorporates 3d printing, video, and found objects. As an artist I wanted to create a tangible object that would facilitate the raising of questions and open a dialogue about a mistunderstood illness. The general public, and even people within the medical profession, do not understand or relate to my everyday challenges. On the outside I look healthy and active, which only exacerbates the discrepancy.   

The mixed media elements are all objects I have collected over the semester. The labels, acting as an enveloping blanket, are from the multitude of prescriptions I tried, to mixed success. Because the disease is not well researched or understood it is trial and error to find effective treatment. The pillow is made from a pill bottle. The object overall is designed to look like a nightlight as sleep is so central to the disease. The symptoms are pervasive, affecting all aspects of my life. 

I purposefully chose to represent the sleep/wake paradigm with digital and physical media. Ideally a person should be awake when they are awake and asleep when they are asleep. Instead of living within this binary my brain slips between the two states, often mixing them. These mixed states manifest themselves in unexpected ways. I also experience cataplexy, where my body disconnects from the control of my brain, meanwhile I am fully conscious. When I experience strong emotions or am sleep deprived my symptoms are worse.

The video component is based on a candid photo from a recent sleep study. I did not airbrush or touch up the photo. I wanted to start with an unedited version of myself. Uncensored. No makeup. The 3D printed cover obsucures my face into a mask of a generic, idealized form. The texture of the print is raw, showing through, the matrix of its construction visible. The print embodies the cohesive front I would like to portray, as well as the transition between my composed self and my raw self. Additionally it connotes the haze I find myself in, as I struggle to find my way to clarity. Underneath the challenges I am a real person, with feelings, my eyes a window into the life trapped inside a body that is not always cooperative or enabling.

Overall I wanted the final piece to inspire curiousity and discomfort. The physical object is meant to be handled and feel fragile, barely held together, but presenting a cohesive front.
