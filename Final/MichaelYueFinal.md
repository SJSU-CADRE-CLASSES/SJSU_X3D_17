					Abstract Sculpture




	This project, I changed my mind from building on from my previous project into making an abstract sculpture that tells about the nature of flowers. This abstract flower represent kaleidoscope and spiritual Zen. This design consists of glass spheres represent the blooms and the spiraling Bezier curves as leaves; the entire flower itself suggested Zen power can find its balance towards spiritual beliefs and abstract ion in Zen flower can always an inner peace with people themselves.  The power contain Zen itself is very crucial to stress relief; that is, the divine power of Zen through patience and meditation.  Through patience and meditation, people can relief tensions and tossing away their negativity and embrace the power of positivity. The abstract Zen flower resembled that the positivity will bloom in people’s soul if they can find true happiness in themselves. This spiritual power empowers people to persist with the power of positivity. The glass sphere resembles as a soul-keeper, it helps people to remain their positivity power with themselves as long as they hold their should of positive power in themselves.  I believe that Zen is the most essential energy to relief stress for all kind; such that, this will let people embrace.  In my abstract sculpture, I wanted to narrate my concept as a spiritual belief, Zen and through the story of this power, people will grasp the power eventually leave and accumulate more positive vibes around them.  Through my sculpture, people will learn that Zen can benefit more positive energies and thoughts so that they can absorb the energy of Zen to embrace the spirituality of the positive soul. What drives me to change this sculptural topic is myself, I mostly embrace negative energies in me that I could not let go. For me, Zen is crucial soul to my life, it is essential that I have to educate myself to embrace more positive energy or surroundings than nagging and clinging on negative energy.  Spirituality will move me forward towards brighter tomorrow, while obliterating the negative energy from the past. In the sculptural piece, the flower represents energy of Zen while the positive soul captured and embraced. Positivity soul is contained within the boxes, it suggested that people use spirituality to contain themselves with positive emotions and thoughts; the positivity will retain in themselves eternity.
The reflection symbolizes that positivity will not only reflect bright on themselves, also reflect positive for the society.
