<Basically my narrative for this attributes to the phenomenon of our awareness of time.
How we perceive time, each person has such a varying experience on how precious time truly can be. This in turn creates this sense
of despair and fear for how unknown and intangible time is for us, since we are all on an internal clock if you will. It can control
the minds of our race, in this race against time. Yet time is "eternal", there will always be time. How we as humans chose to understand
that fact is really interesting and sort of an oddity with each person. So I wanted to touch on that with this piece.
