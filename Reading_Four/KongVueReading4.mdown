First of all, the increasing dependency and relationship between us and computers are really interesting. Every day we take a bigger step in intergrading computers to our daily lives. We see this all the time with new technologies like phones, gadgets, home systems, etc. Technology is evolving to become more or less a part of us. In fact, I think we are not very far off from creating someone like the character Major from Ghost in the Shell. 

Another interesting thought is that Ghost in The Shell offers a deep exploration into the risks and benefits from achieving transhumanism. The benefits of being inside a different body that can be repaired, replaced, renewed: immunity to diseases; immunity, in theory, to the possibility of death.   

Of course the other side of the argument is the absence of a biological body. This can naturally lead to detachment from people around us. Human feelings like pain, hunger, lust, are just some of things that make us human.  

I know that it is ignorant to enjoy the idea of integration between computers and machines without giving it a deep analysis. As I dive deeper and deeper though I just find it fun to think of it as something that is possible instead of something that will actually happen in my life time.
