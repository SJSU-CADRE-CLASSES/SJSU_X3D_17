As a viewer of this show a while back, I find the article provided very relatable despite the “white-washing”, as coined by Schindel, which is present in the new film.  The concepts of this animation make one wonder about how far humans would go to enhance their lives for the sake of making life easier.  Now, we enhance our lives with the internet and do so comfortably since we do not have to alter our bodies.  But with the need to cure disease and expedite our advancement in technology, will we go as far as to change our whole bodies for the sake of these things?  I believe if we were to make it as seamless as possible, and a pretty high guarantee that death will not happen, then the average person will probably find it agreeable to go through such a procedure.  

With the concept of the puppet master, although I did not make much of it watching this as a child, it’s shocking to think that although one would think our consciousness is what makes us, well us, that we would still need to assert our existence through a physical body.  Not unlike our current obsession with gadgets, making ourselves relevant in physical form could become the new obsession.
