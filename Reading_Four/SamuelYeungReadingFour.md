	The issues of Makoto Kusanagi in Ghost in the Shell resemble the veil of anonymity on the internet. The internet can be used to erase physical presence and only reveals what a person wishes to show. But certain aspects of a person, such as personality, will eventually slip through even the most cautious facade. A major difference with the internet and Kusanagi's cyborg body is that users of the internet can simply stop the pretense after they leave their computers while it is simply life for Kusanagi. However, there are some who continue their pretense in their daily lives and in this way they are similar to Kusanagi. As far as the world is concerned, their appearance is how they really are. It is possible to modify one's appearance to show individuality, although it may be more difficult for Kusanagi with set models that rolled off of a product line.
  
	The Puppet Master could be said to resemble the hacktivist group Anonymous. Anonymous is only identified by a name and avatar while the Puppet Master is an artificial intelligence program that claims it had gained a consciousness. There is nothing of substance connecting either to the physical world, although the Puppet Master is trying to make his presence known while Anonymous wants to remain unknown.
