<p>Ghost in the Shell is a name of an anime franchise, but it also lays insight on sci-fi becoming reality. The anime centers around a cyborg called the “Major.” All that is biological about the Major’s body is their brain and spine. Their body is a shell to contain what is the only thing human about them physically. The anime explores Major’s identity and if their existence is valid. I ponder the same thing if what makes us human is our consciousness. Technology is evolving to where we can augment human parts for machines. It is in the realm of possibility that somewhere in the future, anyone could opt to become a ghost in the shell to prolong life.

I used to watch this show when I was younger. It is crazy how ten years is leap to suggest that we may be able to put consciousness into a machine. If given the option to become a machine, I don’t think I will be able to do it. There must be a huge disassociation that I would feel transitioning from a human body. The Major resonates ambiguity because they do not represent a gender or a race.
