After reading the article, I agree that we are currently not living in a science fiction world where we use technology to enhance ourselves. In the animation “Ghost in the Shell”, they use technology to enhance their body and mind by replacing body parts. Similar to the animation, we currently use the internet to better ourselves through the shared connection and knowledge it provides. Technology has evolved at such a rapid pace that we have developed body replacements. I see prosthetics in real life as Ghost in the Shell’s cybernetics enhancement counterpart. We replace parts of our body that is not functioning well with prosthetics. Prosthetics is just more uncommon than the cybernetic enhancements that is provided in the animation.

I feel like Shirow Masamune’s prediction may be correct in the near future. His prediction is that lifelike robot bodies by 2029. This year alone, I have seen many near perfect realistic bodies of robots; however, I do not see their minds to resemble humanities. People with cyberbrains and cybernetic enhancement in the animation have struggled with self identify and that’s what differentiate a person and a robot. I can not see robots interpreting emotions because of how complicated it is.
