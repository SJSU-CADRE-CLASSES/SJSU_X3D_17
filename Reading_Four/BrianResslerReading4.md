Brian Ressler Reading 4

This reading was particularly interesting as it greatly contrasts the concepts in the last one.  This one discusses the boundary between the physical body and the digital world.  I always have found it interesting when old sort of entertainment attempts to predict what the future will be like, especially when that future is already technically our present.  But in the case of ghost in the shell, this is not yet the case and this certainly leaves room for the mind to wander as to what the future might be like with regards to how our physical bodies will interact with what we know as the internet, as opposed to how we traditionally do with our fingers.  

All in all, this is a show Iâ€™ve been meaning to watch and the concepts in the article make me more curious to explore what other humans imagine about how we will one day interact with technology.  Will we possibly reach a point where our only biological components are those needed for us to process thoughts and other cognitive processes?  If so, how would we do so in a way where consumers would find it safe enough for it to be worth it?  I overall found this reading to be interesting as in our own class, we are already considering concepts of generating artificial limbs through 3D.
