The article was an interesting read as it covers on the transhumanists world. Technology is growing rapidly every single day, and to know that one-day Transhumanist may exists is kind of crazy. For the passed 20 years, technology has been the driving force of our society and for it to grow as time pass is amazing. Our technology is so advanced today that we currently have the ‘electronic skin’ that can be used to locate prosthetic limbs and all of this is being powered by graphene. These technology skins can be used in robots to enhance their performance and make it an improved machine overall. We now have robots and machines that can do jobs that humans can do but faster. We have self-check outs and also a electronic banker right outside our local bank. This is amazing because we did not have this kind of technology back then, and to know what technology may be like in the future is questionable. Technology can be a scary thing if it is used unethically. There are infinite possibilities on what a person may do if technology do get really advanced. Fusing technology within humans such as in Ghost in a Shell can change generations as it modifies the human body and may affect how humans may be produced later on.
