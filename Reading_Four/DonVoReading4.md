<body>I can really relate to this whole concept of transhumanists to a degree. Well… mostly on the physical side where I always wanted to replace my damaged body parts to enhance my back to the normal functioning state. All those years of pain and depression of having my left side of my body cribbed gone overnight. Though now I learned to work with it and train with it which I find made me mentally stronger. Although through cybernetic enhancements, it would help make physically handicapped people’s life a whole lot easier but I can see this getting out of hand. Like I can see the people abusing this and getting cybernetic enhancements just as a cosmetic use. Like it said in the article that Major Kusanagi stumbled upon similar physical copies of herself. That would freak me out honestly. Using parts to make myself look completely different or more beautiful then my original human looks. The whole mass of people are irrational so might do on the whim… This would then tumble into another can of worms if I go on further. As I said in the beginning, I only agree with this to a degree. Physically help people is a yes and other crazy stuff is a no no. </body>
