I’m a big fan of anime, so I really enjoyed reading this article talking about the anime “Ghost in a Shell.” I always seem to find that every anime has a sort of concept or message in it, a lot like when an artist put up a gallery with an artist statement. Reading about the theme of the separation of one’s humanity from one’s self due to technology advances, it made me think of how much time people spend using the computer or any other technology. We have certainly grown very dependent on technology. Then there is the concept of leaving behind our gender and what-not behind when we use the internet. The article talked about how the main character in the anime can show both female and male aspects even though the character is a female. When we are on the internet, no one knows who we are, what our genders are, our ethnicity, etc. It is like when one is playing on an online game on the internet. Barely anyone gives their real name because they usually use a username, and they have the choice of whether to be a boy or a girl. The anime this article talks about sure highlights how the internet can affect people.
