	The article about Transhumanism was a very interesting reading, as an anime from over 20 years ago had an idea that humans today see as possible. It is very fascinating to think that transhumanism will and can occur sooner or later is a breakthrough in technology, it is already happening, but not to the extent on how the Japanese animation portrayed it as. Humans will gradually come to that, since we are already cloning body parts and testing them on animals. It is very possible but in due time. The anime is way ahead of its time, but nearly taking place as years’ pass. The movie Star Wars, where Luke got his hand sliced off, became a turning point where the character should feel that all hope is lost, but he was “fixed-up” quickly by a robot, replacing his hand with robotic tissue hand replacement. This was new to many individuals around that time and it became a practice where an amputee can still have hope, by receiving a prosthetic leg or arm. This is a hell of a time to live, because we humans are evolving quickly and growing as time goes. There will be more and more innovations in the near future and it will be great.
