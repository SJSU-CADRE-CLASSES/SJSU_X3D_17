This article is really interesting because it is covering on the topic of integrating machines into people, virtual presence, and so forth.
Even though I have not watched the anime ,Ghost in a Shell, I am able to visualize technology’s advancement reaching that point.
I’m honestly frightened because as population expands rapidly, we are making technology to accommodate it; In this case, virtual presence.
As ironic as for us making virtual installations, we still need physical storage to accommodate to it; in this case, hard drives, memories, etc.

The concept of AI here resembles another anime called Psycho Pass; in this story, the whole city is ran by an AI system based on the brains of criminals to do analysis.
Ironically, I bring this up because the criminal brains are detached from their bodies, and embedded into the system.
The systems can identify other criminals, and measure their behavior.
In a sense, those criminal brains are in one place, but they can sense a lot of things.
In essence, I’m worried about machine embedded humans, and vice versa because it will raise a lot of “What if’s questions;
What if government can punish the population at once? What will happen to our well being, and privacy?
What if we don’t want it? Will we be forced to integrate into our bodies?
