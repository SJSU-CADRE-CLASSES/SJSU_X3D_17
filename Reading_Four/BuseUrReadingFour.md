	The article Transhumanism and the Promise of the Bodiless Mind in the Original Ghost in the Shell by Dan Schindel was very fun and exciting to read. While I was reading the article, I went back to my childhood like about 25 years back and I remembered the moments that I asked my dad if there will be flying cars in the future. He was saying that there will be, but it may take another 50 years. So, he may not be able to drive one. Of course, the movies were the ones that made me come up with that kind of question, but it means that the material is always given to the people by sources like movies, animes, etc. So, they can go beyond and take the material to the next level to make it happen. But anyway, it is very interesting that how much people can imagine and predict the future.
	As in Ghost in the Shell anime (Even though I haven't watched it yet but, I guess this article is enough to guess what is happening in the movie), it seems like the prediction of the scenarists was true. Because we live in a world that machines have become the main part in almost every industry. Machine learning is already at a high level. The amount of data used by machine learning algorithms are growing and with the help of much better hardware, machine learning systems process this data, train themselves and become as good as humans. With this growth rate, I would think that they will go beyond human intelligence.
