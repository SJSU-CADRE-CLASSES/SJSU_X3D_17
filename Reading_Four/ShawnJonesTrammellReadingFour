<p>Having seen Ghost in a Shell, this article was a really great read. The thought of our society becoming transhuman and connecting to the digital world and a network that connects all systems is an interesting one. While being an older source of entertainment and having multiple animation,video game, movie and visual novel adaptations, the concept of of Ghost in a Shell strives to predict the future of our society, technically our present right now. While at the moment we enhance our lives with the internet, we also have the need to cure disease and accelerate our advancement in technology. In the near future we may change our whole bodies so that we could, via our cyberbrains and cybernetic enhancements, always be connected to the internet and other systems and put an end to diseases. If we were to make this change as smooth as possible and have a high guarantee that death will not happen, then the average person would probably find it agreeable to go through such a procedure to become transhuman.</p> 
<p>The only real problem would be, like in the animation, people with cyberbrains and cybernetic enhancements may struggle with self identify, feeling more robotic than human and questioning their humanity. This then could possibly send one into a depressed state and even become suicidal.</p>
<p>To become transhuman we must also question what it means to be human. What does it take to be human? A body made of flesh and can feel the world around us? A brain that can comprehend emotions? Or is it a soul that really makes us human?</p>
