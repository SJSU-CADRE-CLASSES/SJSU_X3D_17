Inspired by the forms in Persian gardens, I have created three sculptures that would represent an abstract sculpture garden. The main sculpture wich is the glass Mandala, is cymmetrical and centeralized the same as the layout of all Persian gardens. This form is seen in 2D in many tiles, rugs, ... My second sculpture is an organic model bringing more clarity and reflection to this abstract garden. Water (fountains or pools) and mirrors are common elements used in the design of Persian gardens. The third sculpture are two trees to complete the nature.
