  The thought of artificial intelligence with the capability to really feel emotions inspires mixed emotions within me. Machines would become more than a simple tool at that point and could force us to reevaluate our views of them. They may take on a status similarly to other sentient beings if their intelligence develops to match or surpass that of our own. Their ability for evolution can exceed that of humanity and it would not be unthinkable for them to eventually become the dominant race on the planet. They could also colonize other planets with relative ease, having the ability to function in harsher environments.
  
	The ability of artificial intelligence to trick humans into thinking that they were also human is one shared by other art forms. Virtual reality worlds are the first to pop into mind with their ability to mimic the world, although our suspension of disbelief usually plays a role in their acceptance. Paintings and photographs can similarly fool the perception of the viewer. Artists have been attempting to reproduce nature for quite a while and machines have seemingly infinite options otherwise, perhaps avenues that would be more interesting to explore. As Benjamin Bratton had already stated, it is flawed to judge artificial intelligence by their ability to resemble humans.
