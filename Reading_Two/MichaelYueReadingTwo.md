  From the presentation, I learned that environmental and biological factors that can be modeled from 3D modeling. I agree on his opinion that robotics and cyborgs are now replacing the humanity and transforming into a digital world; in other words, it is considered a computerized humans where humanity is drowned into source codes.  Even biological factors are now programmable, programming genetics and bioinformatics are contributing a heavy factor in many medical practices. However, there is situation apophhenia occurs in genetic programming; that is, recognizing a pattern through DNA and re-prorammed genetics patterns throughout the code itself.  From this point, I support his talks from technological point of view. In many practices, 3D modeling is important to dentistry and biological practices, like orthodontist making a model for a retainers and biomedical engineers making a model for artificial limbs for people have weak limbs. In the future, the tools that we apply is important to multiple factors. In many 3D printing practices, it is essential to have broad ranges of applications and know where to apply them in a way that is critical. Overall, the talk endorses very brilliant emphasis on humans and AI; but, I have to criticize that some parts were comparing human intelligence to artificial intelligence. This is false, artificial intelligence is not considered “natural” whereas human intelligence were “born” and it is “natural”.
