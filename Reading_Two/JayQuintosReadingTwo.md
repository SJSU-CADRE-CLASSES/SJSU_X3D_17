<p>The video interview of Benjamin Bratton was a very informative 2 hour long lecture, which he touched upon the modern event, and what could be happening in the future. His take upon the internet and its growth made a lot sense due to the evolution of the computers and its Artificial intelligence. His views towards the upcoming future, really puts my mind into a sense of disfigurement of reality, due to the point he has made in this lecture. Google knows our search history, email, and our interest, which is becoming highly accepted or just forgotten by many unknowing individuals. His incorporation of the movies, animals, and plants are fascinating, but the future he talked about have no human in existing, yet we are just the robots for the animals. The future could be bright or dark for the humans, but it is up to us whether we make it or not. Time is going by fast, and technology is growing faster and faster, that we depend on things too much. Our dependency on technologies will catch up to us, and probably ruin us in the long run or it could better us. His lecture is informative and very mind opening topic, he might be on a different level than most normal human beings already.</p>
