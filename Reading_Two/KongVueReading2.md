Benno Premsela Lezing 2015 talk with Benjamin H. Bratton was really hard to follow due to my lack of vocabulary and as well as understanding of the English language. There big words and long confusing sentence structures that kept preventing me from understanding what he is saying. I have to move on to the text version of the speech to get a better understanding of the topics discussed in Bratton’s speech. The first thing that interested me, of course, was when he talked about Sabshi Pod City. I have seen these buildings before in “10 abandoned cities” YouTube videos but this was my first hearing about species of mantis that had overtaken the ruins. I got a chill when he said, “We are their tools; we are the robots for future insects”. I am the type of person that favors nature but the thought of disappearing had me at a loss of words. I questioned my well-being as well as others around me. Sanzhi Pod City is a scary symbolic example of an unavoidable future. 

Later on Bratton talked about the improvement of visual sensors and then connect it to the idea of how human beings look like as objects of perception from the position of machines. He mentioned Google’s Deep Dream and how it hallucinates dogs where there are none and even sometimes identify people as dogs if told to look hard enough. I started thinking of how other species, besides machines, would perceive us as objects of perception.
