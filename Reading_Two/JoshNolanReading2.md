Benno Premsela Lezing 2015 talk with Benjamin H. Bratton was dull and hard to follow, due to the monotone way he speaks. I noticed I would zone out listening to him, getting distracted by the screen distortions and pop-ups. When Bratton started talking about artificial intelligence and learning the random pop-ups reminded me of advertisements and what form of intelligence it may have. With websites like facebook monitoring what an individual does online and then markets advertisements based on their interests makes me think about the future of ads. A scene much like the mall from the film Minority Report, advertisements learn your name through online use and constantly bombard you; especially in a society so media driven and obsessed with consumerism it’s not hard to imagine. I also found it very disturbing when he mentioned that all it takes to express emotion to a human is just simple “key” triggers. The baby seal does not love the human, but mimics what we want to see. Like when robotics advances enough to make androids the feelings they express are just code, and code is easily manipulated. How will robotic crime be dealt with? This talk almost reinforces that the future could be a wonderful, but also technology could wipe us out.
