<h1>Second Reading Assignment</h1>
<p>To be completely honest, I had a difficult time understanding Benjamin Bratton’s lecture because of all the high-end term he used. To add on to the difficulty, the video effects were distracting and was so unnecessary. Besides that, Bratton’s lecture on artificial intelligences mixing with the human race was interesting to say the least. He goes on to say, “The real philosophical lessons of AI will have less to do with humans teaching machines how to think than with machines teaching humans a fuller and truer range of what thinking can be.” In short, this is saying that humans make AI to teach us rather than the other way around. My thoughts on this is that humans in general have needs such as emotion for one. We can make a robot with AI to respond to us with those emotions. Though the robot has to act like it has emotions to pass our judgement of having emotions back to us. I believe that because of this, we human will learn more about ourselves individually because we just programmed the robot to express what we want. What we want is probably what we desire unconsciously. From this, we just learned a bit more about ourselves. I will have to say that this goes well together with the movie “Ex Machina” where the AI robot used the emotional attachment of the man to set her free. While the man realized that he was doped and learning that he was completely used by his emotions..</p>
