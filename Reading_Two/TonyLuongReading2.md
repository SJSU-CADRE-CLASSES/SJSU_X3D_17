In the interview of Benjamin Bratton, he discussed many things about the future and the Ai that advances with it. What really stood out to me was his explanation of humans having a connection with Ai “robots” and how they have feelings for them since these robots gives off the same “affection” to their owners. What was interesting was that humans are mainly reading the cues of these robots are showing rather than detecting the feeling; it’s really a one-way projection and not a recognition. This is somewhat terrifying to hear because we are using some other alternatives to satisfy our affection for an inanimate object. His talk has got me thinking how far we’ve gotten with technology and how advanced its become in a short period of time. Who knows what the world would be like when Ai becomes a major part of our life; it may be a good or bad thing, but for sure, it has a potential to used as a tool to improve the living condition of humans.
