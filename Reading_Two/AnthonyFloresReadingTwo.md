<p>After watching the video, there were a lot of things that intrigued me. For example, the notion that humans can be seen a robotic workforce creating terrains for species of the animal kingdom. It’s ironic to think about it in that way because humans are playing the role of as unintended artistic architects for insect organisms. Although the space was intended to be used for military soldiers, the Orchid Mantis occupy the space of Sanzhi city instead. This is also somewhat similar to how individuals critique visually perceive and interpret a work of art. In one instance, a person can perceive a work one way while another people can see that same space a completely contradicting way.

<p>On another note, the explanation A.I.’s made me think critically about what could make them human. As explained an A.I.’s response can be seen as object reacting to cues rather than an emotional response. Although an actual person might interpret the A.I.’s response as human, it is only responding to conditioned cues. This is similar to how interactive projections can react in a controlled environment. For example, the projector uses a camera to project a display while a motion sensor is used to detect movement cues. Combine together this would make a response that seem interactive and possibly artificial.
