What caught my interest most in Benjamin Brattonâ€™s talk was the part about how Artificial Intelligence tricks human minds to mistake reaction to cues with real emotions. It reminded me of the [imprinting protocol scene](https://www.youtube.com/embed/0M1e8zt6DCw) in the movie A.I. Artificial Intelligence. 

This video was a very long speech to keep up with and the visual effects on it were a bit distracting as well. But what I understood is that Bratton is mainly discussing computation,  smart cities, user identification, and how they all blend with each other as one whole megastructure through technology. 

We are using AI already in our everyday lives, for instance by proving being we are real users through captcha images. At the same time, we are creating artworks with AI and image recognition systems that opens an entire new spectrum of ideas to artists which is very fascinating to me.
