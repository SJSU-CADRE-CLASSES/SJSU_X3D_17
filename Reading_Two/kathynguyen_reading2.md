Benjamin Bratton made many interesting points in his lecture in the video. Such as the mantis species that inhabited the building structures that was meant to be a vacation place for people. Something that is made to be used for a certain purpose is suddenly used for something else that no one could predict. People usually see something with one purpose, but that thing can have a vast variety of uses no one could think of before. Then Bratton goes on to talk about artificial intelligence. Almost everyone on the planet use and rely on technology these days, and much of the technology uses artificial intelligence to operate. Then he discusses how things can be from the point of view of the artificial intelligence in the search engine, Google. It could be seen that things can be seen a lot different to an artificial intelligence. But with A.I., its use is continuingly growing as more technology is being developed. Bratton even talked about this concept where cars should be equipped with cameras and other tech so that it does not have to be parked. He talks about how artificial intelligence is going to change the design of the city, one that is not for humans. It is like the vacation buildings mentioned at the beginning of the video where instead of people staying in the buildings, mantis species settle down there instead. A.I. seems to be able to find unpredictable uses for the city that is not just for people.
