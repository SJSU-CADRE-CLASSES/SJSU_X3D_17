Benjamin Bratton’s Artificial Intelligence ‘s is somewhat similar to what I have in mind: symbiosis relation, replication of processes, and integration to daily lives. Artificial Intelligence is already being implemented very noticeable ways, or minimally. My example for Artificial Intelligence integration would be utilizing Siri on the iOS device; Siri can do multiple tasks, but she needs constant access to the internet. In a sense, Siri falls into the symbiosis relation with the user, and the internet; users would have to charge the phone for Siri to work, Siri needs the internet to be accessed, and the modern users will depend on Siri for voice command based tasks (hands free).

I am interested mostly in human symbiosis relation with AI because AI are becoming more powerful, and we do need one another. Another example for this would be a SJSU student’s AI built to analyze the quality of the picture. In computational creativity class, one of the graduate/alumni students presented an AI that is based on his preference. The AI went through a cycle of learning until it was optimal for the creator’s preference: if a picture had bad color, out of focus, and so forth; the AI will give it a bad rating. In a sense, the symbiotic relationship is this: creators teach AI tasks, and AI will learn accordingly.
