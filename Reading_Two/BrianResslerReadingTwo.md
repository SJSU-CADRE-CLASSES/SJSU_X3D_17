This video was charmingly creepy in the sense that it made allusions to things in nature such as the newly discovered manteses to make comparisons to unpredictable technologies such as as Artificial intelligence.  On the other hand, it made me really thing that when we are gone from the planet and if any other species survive, what will become of the buildings we've created for specific purposes?  Will animals just see these artificial creations just as any other other possible habitat to survive?  This is an interesting transition into the topics Lezing regards as evolutionary robotics and artificial intelligence.

He talks about this concept of upgrading the user as opposed to the traditional upgrading of computers.  He then compares different kinds of artificial intelligence which is interesting as he does so in the context of classical thinkers like copernicus.  Furthermore, what I really took away from this is the concept of the improvement of sensors over the years so much that importance is given to the design of artificial skin.  We seem to crave so much, to breathe new life into these machines, to allow them to feel things like empathy and in order to this we must press to emulate ever aspect of what makes us human.  And yet despite are efforts, do any of these android creations that we've seen, actually have some sort of awareness?
