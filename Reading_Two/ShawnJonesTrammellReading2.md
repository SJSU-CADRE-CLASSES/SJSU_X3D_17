Benjamin Brattonâ€™s lecture has a very interesting look at the future of humanity and artificial intelligence and how we may coexist.The idea of living with A.I. is an interesting thought. At some point in time some of us may have synthetic body parts the replace ones that we have lost. We may also live side by side with A.I. passing as humans.

The 3D printers we have in class could help start this live up. Prosthetics for amputees and people born missing appendages have already been made using 3D printers. Doctors have made synthetic organs from 3D printed base models for people who need transplants.

In one of my favorite animation RWBY, the creator Monty Oum plays with the idea of an A.I. living among people. In the show the A.I. is hidden and protected by her creators. She is watched and guarded like a weapon, which she is, but the first weapon to have a soul.
