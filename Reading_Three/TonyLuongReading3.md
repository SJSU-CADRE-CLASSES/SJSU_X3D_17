Doa Aly, the author, explained to its audience about the buildings in Rana ElNemr’s photographs. The compassion she sees each images and the way she explained each photographs were mind boggling. She goes into deep details/ meanings and what each picture meant to her. Even though I love looking at Rana’s photographs, the way Doa Aly described her feelings for each picture just blows me away. I don’t think I can ever explain like Doa Aly did just by looking at a photography. She understands and expressed what each architecture made her feel and maybe the reason behind each buildings/designs. By examining Rana’s pictures, there are many architectural designs that are very complex and intriguing to look at. 
Doa Aly went on talking about ElNemr’s images of Khan Al- Azizeya, where she explained about the architectural design of it. She explained how the abstractness of the image mirrors the terrible moments in reality. Each piece and design she mentioned are somewhat related to one another. It’s like she knew what the builders were thinking and their design process. She took the time to inspect and educate herself with each picture. Each design she talked about has a meaning, even if there’s no architecture, it still has a meaning.
