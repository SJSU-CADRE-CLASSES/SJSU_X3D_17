Doa Aly is criticizing how photography works because it only immortalizes a portion of reality.
Aly’s analogy is that of looking out of the window, and only seeing the bird fly by; meaning that you only see what is happening within that frame.
The example work I want to imply is Rana Elnemr’s Root of Desire, and how Aly discussed upon this.
Aly criticizes how Elnemr’s work focuses only in certain angles, and leave it up to audience’s interpretation.

I honestly think Doa Aly stance is contradictory because being an artist herself, she should be able to view or interpret ideas from both artist and audience perspectives.
I do understand what she meant in when the artist took unseen parts of Egypt, and displayed them. My gripe is that Aly’s criticizing only the portion of reality go against the role of being an artist; artists present what we want audience to see and feel, and the rest is up to them.
By me saying it does make sense when Aly criticizing Elnemr’s work makes it contradictory too because I am judging someone else’s ideation and practice.
Overall, I think there is that loop of someone putting out work, critiquing, and so forth.
