<p>After reading the article “Condemned to Depth: Invisible Architecture in Rana ElNemr’s Streams of Synonyms,” by Doa Aly I found it that it was a difficult reading to understand. However, when Aly started talking about the subject about “every image is a product of private perceptions,” I was able to relate it to how people interpret objects, images, grammar or videos. For example, when a person sees a sentence describing a scene or a place, each individual will come up with their own picture of how they image that scene. The same can be said about movie trailers and videos. For instance, when there is a new Marvel super hero movie trailer, there usually is massive amounts of speculation and inferences. What I mean is everyone is wondering what is going to happen in the movie, and they build off the images they saw to make educated guess or ideas of what could happen. It isn’t set in stone, but it mystifies and satisfies us temporarily.</P>

	<p>On another note, the article also mentions different “possibilities of interpretation.” I found it interesting that individuals at times can interpret images in a similar way while individuals can also have different opinions at the same time.  </p>
