After reading the article, I do start to see that architecture and plants are similar in their life cycle. I know that plants grow from a seed and after the plant is pollinated, it makes seeds and dies. Then those seeds grow into new plants. Architecture buildings also have to spout from a seed, but the seed is someone’s idea and the way it grows is when it’s being built. After it is complete, that is when it has bloomed and for a long while, it will stay blooming as it fulfills its intended purpose and is constantly used. But like plants, architecture buildings cannot do what it is supposed to do. But then it sprouts again with a different purpose that someone else thought of. I have never thought that buildings and plants could have anything that was similar in a way. This goes to show how an artist can think after looking at photos of old objects and buildings that were abandoned. And speaking of the photos, they do depict places and buildings that are no longer in use and is decaying, like how plants turn back into soil. But the articles talks about how the architecture is unaware that it is decaying, maybe because the building is still standing and so it can still be used again.
