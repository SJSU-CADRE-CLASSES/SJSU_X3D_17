In the reading the author, Doa Aly described Rana El Nemr as a fascinating photographer, by telling us the reader her feelings towards these photos. The way Aly described El Nemr’s work about the natural plant compared to the man’s architecture, could be relatable as art progress and many ways have been improved or even made better as time passed. Architecture will continue to grow and become more hi tech, in fact there are many structures that man has already made. So, it is believable that El Nemr’s views towards her works are fascinating in how much true it is.
