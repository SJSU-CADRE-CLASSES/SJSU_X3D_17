Aly, the author, is fascinated with Rana El Nemr’s photographs of buildings. I understand her admiration because I like photographs of architecture too. I cannot compare to Aly’s overwhelming descriptions of what is beyond the images. She describes the photographs in a romantic fashion and how each structure yearns to be more. Aly implies that the photographs are synonyms to the societies they are establish in. To me, I see photographs of an unfinished projects that was abandoned. The author admits that the photographs are bland for transparency of the project. I disagree because El Nemr should put more effort in drawing attention to what she wants the viewer to see. Leaving the viewer to dig through the photograph is apathetic.

Aly believes that El Nemr’s photographs reveal the economics, politics, and religion of the area the structure is set in. She uses El Nemr’s images of Khan Al-Azizeya as an example. The building is unfinished making it invisible to the public. Invisibility referring to the building becoming camouflaged among the ruins it is set in. Its ambiguity does not bring the audience to search for answers. In my opinion, the images do not tell me anything. Considering how chaotic an environment can be, the unfinished buildings show me a serene state. The viewer cannot derive the abstract message the images represent without exposition. The colors and framing do not convey the same enchantment for me. Aly has to act as a liaison to define El Nemr’s photographs for me to glimpse beyond concrete.
