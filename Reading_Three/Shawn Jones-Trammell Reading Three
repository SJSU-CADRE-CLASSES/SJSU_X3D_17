This essay is a bit confusing to me. I think I might be me over thinking how to explain or understand the meaning of what Doa is trying to say. Doa talks alot about imagery and the significance of a captured image of a space. Specifically on how an artist initially designed the composition to frame the subject and create a division between nature and man made object. Doa is a bit obsessed with the artwork of Rana ElNemer but refuses any idea of a digital image because to her, it lacks the true process of what the space represents architecturally. Those images create an uncertainty towards the reality of its true space. To me, Doa is trying to show us that a space can be objectively looked at as just a natural process by shattering its invisibility and removing our own thought processes. We do this by building spaces to connect and understand. Rejecting imagery of space is the same as rejecting a part of history. Time only moves forward for us and as humans, we have the capacity to recall memories of the past and can also review images of a space in which to remember. The projection of our own history towards an image makes it a unique experience and space yet subtly reminds us of its true meaning.
