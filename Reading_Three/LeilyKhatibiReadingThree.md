# Reading Three

What surprises me most about this article is how Doa Aly, the writer, is explaining Rana ElNemr’s photographs in such a whimsical manner, without experiencing “the city that never becomes” through her own eyes. 

These photographs of Khan Al-Azizeya reminds me of old small towns in Iran, which people have abandoned and relocated to big cities instead. The scenery is very much the same: a frame full of nothingness. I personally don’t understand how the absense of humans creating this bare void space in Elnemr’s photography can be so enchanting for Aly.

I took this photo about 6 years ago in a very old town near Mesr desert in Iran. Having seen similar environments such as the one in the photo above, helps me better imagine the spaces in Elnemr’s photographs. For the wall text of her _Streams of Synonyms_ exhibition I admire how she defines architecture as an imaginary exchange: a dialogue between real space and 'images'.
