I found the reading for El Nemr interesting because it seems she has some sort of affinity for Egypt which happens to be a place I’ve always been interested in, especially with ancient history.  As for how her photographs look, it gave me the impression that she was trying to create this world which no people inhabited, and yet all these manmade structures exist next to these natural beings, which are the plants.
As for her message, I think this was very subject to interpretation but I think El Nemr was trying to represent places that people of the middle or lower class tend to roam.  And in addition to this, I think her use of plants is something to do with the representation of time.  She seems to show these overgrown areas and it gives this eerie feeling that people have not been there for a long time.

As far as my own work, the fact that I haven’t tampered in themes like this one motivates me to explore this sort of territory in future projects.  I tend to lean towards more digital art such as drawing with a digital tablet and other design related works.
