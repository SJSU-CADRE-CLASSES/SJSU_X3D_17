I had not heard of Rana ElNemr before this reading. But after this reading I still do not know who EINemr is. In fact, her name isn’t even spelled correctly according to a cursory google search. Her name is Rana El Nemr.  Doa Aly describes El Nemr’s work in such a romantic way that I was not able to come to my own conclusion about El Nemr. Aly endearingly tells us that El Nemr’s photographs are a dichotomy between the wild plant life that is nature with the strong abstract concrete that man creates into buildings. I feel like I was overwhelmed by the admiration Aly presents or that my reading conditions were unsavory (my family is watching the walking dead loudly, my husband is playing a first person shooter on the computer next to me, and the loud washing machine is.. washing). I feel like I might grow to like El Nemr or even Aly’s essay on a third or fourth read through so perhaps I will revisit it when I decide to read or research for enjoyment rather than to read by a specified date.
