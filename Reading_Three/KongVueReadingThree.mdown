I have to be honest, it was really confusing to understand what Doa Aly was saying about the works of Rana ElNemr. From what I gather Aly seems really interested in photos of architecture especially urban development. Aly briefly talk about Egypt’s urban development at the beginning of the essay. From what I can infer it seems like she is saying something about how old architecture linger around as we continued to build new things on top it.

Aly specifically talked about Rana ElNemr’s work called  A Chapter of Synonyms. She goes on talking about the imaginary exchanged between real space and the actual images. I am not sure what she is trying to convey here. She did go into a lot of detail describing why Rana ElNemr’s photographs are purposely shot to be hollowed impressions of architecture and vegetation. 

She later goes and talk about a video The Ministry of Squares and Roundabouts (2014), which I wish there was a link to because I need visuals. Overall this was a confusing read for me. I got bits and pieces from what Aly is saying about ElNemr’s work but is still confused on the point she is trying to get at. There seems to be a connection between capitalism and modernism and how that is destroying architecture.
