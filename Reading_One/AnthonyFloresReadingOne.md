<h2>Reading One Response</h2>


<p>After reading the article “Under Fire: 3D Animation Pedagogy and Industry Complicity in New Media Education” by Claudia Hart, some insight is shed about using 3D animation software as a form of medium for new media artists and artists alike. In my experience when I visited private art colleges, they do seem to favor narrow production abilities instead of thinking creatively. The industry style of teaching in my opinion really detours contemporary artist from applying their skills into a 3D programs or classes. Because of that, I think that people feel that they don’t belong in a “Rendering” class if they are a photographer or a “Modeling” if they are a sculptor.  </p>

<p>The reason I want to work in 3D Modeling classes is so that I have an edge in internships with companies like Pixar or Lucas Films. As I token a wide variety of art classes especially in drawing, I lack the computer classes to further myself in animation. I to be able to apply my drawings into 3D programs. Although I have token some video film classes, I feel that my background in video editing was taught on the lines of the industry of production. Nonetheless, this will be the first classes in which I learn a program that is outside of video and image programs.</p>
