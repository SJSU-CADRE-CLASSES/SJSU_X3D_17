The article titled “Under Fire” is a persuasive piece by Claudia Hart which has the goal of both criticizing the hyper masculine entertainment industry (specifically with what involves 3D entertainment) and also to point out the narcissism that comes out of contemporary entertainment which prevents many unique projects from being developed by students.  What I think she means to express to us as readers, is that she does not just intend to criticize individuals which create this environment, but I believe she intends to inspire aspiring students by calling for them to do better and to not so easily accept the industry standard which really narrows down what creators believe they can profit from or get recognition for.  What is most unique about Hart’s argument is that yes she does tend to directly criticize but she also recognizes that her steretypes are not the actual reason for this stunted growth in creativity.  However, as a female, Hart’s argument really moves me because often we are underestimated for our capacity for skills such as 3D modeling or game making.  To think this course can actually do me the favor of getting full-fledged 3D skills, is a pleasure because the opportunity to change the norm with unique entertainment, and likewise impress future clients and employers.  I also see many uses for this kind of content creation such as creating parts for commercial products through 3D printing or creating more unique web and or app content as one of my aspirations is to affect the mobile markets which are flourishing today, with games and apps that I hope to create.
