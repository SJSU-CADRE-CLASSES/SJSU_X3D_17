Claudia Hart begins by writing her view of the workforce machine from her perspective with a feminist view. Then she shifts her argument to admit that she was wrong about blaming the workforce for creating an uninspiring environment and credits the 3d pedagogy with the blame. Her first couple of paragraphs about women in the 3d entertainment workplace distracts the reader from her actual argument. By ignoring the first part of her essay, I was able to understand that she believes that teachers are training students to be productive members in the business machine without worrying or even thinking about the whole as an art. The students should be artists first creating works of art rather than pumping out the bare minimum necessary for a particular project. 

I personally agree with the idea of teaching or learning the creative whole as art and then applying that to the medium you plan to use. Simply put, artists should have free range to create and interpret first then apply their knowledge to doing a specific job.

Surprisingly, I find myself more attracted to the “old” styles of art (film photographer, charcoal drawings, etc) the deeper I study digital media art. I want to explore new media art and understand and develop skills so I can further hone my non-digital art skills. I am interested in artists who use new technologies to explore older techniques or ideas of art. For example, in 2013, a tattoo studio posted an unfilled—or white—QR code in a newspaper advertising a job opening. Potential applicants had to delicately fill in the QR code with a black pen and then scan it into their phone which prompted a website to open with a job application form (Nudd 2013). 

I want to study virtual 3d because I want to explore a new way of looking at the world around me. By creating objects with depth and that are sometimes tangible can change the way I see objects around me. Many set pieces for films are created using 3d modeling and videogames are starting to become popular to use on 3d headsets. The hobbit, for example, uses 3d modeling to create amazing designs and set pieces (Diba 2015). Seeing this kind of art inspires me to create something with my hands or with a computer.
