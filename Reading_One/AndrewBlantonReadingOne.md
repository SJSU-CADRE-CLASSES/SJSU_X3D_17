First Reading Assignment
------------------------

Hi All And Welcome! For Tuesday please read the article located [here](http://www.claudiahart.com/theory/theorydocs/UnderfirePanelPresentation2010.pdf) and push your response to the git repo. Please write a paragraph to a page (200-600 words) discussing what you think of this article as well as some of the reasons that you are interested in working with virtual 3D.

It's always a good idea to cite outside sources in Chicago format([1](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html)) and try to cite specific artist or projects that you are interested in. I also encourage you to incorporate images and gif's to further bolster your arguments.
