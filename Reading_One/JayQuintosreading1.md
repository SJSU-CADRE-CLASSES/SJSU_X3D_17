<h2> Reading One </h2>

<p>The reading of “Under Fire: 3D Animation Pedagogy and Industry Complicity in New Media Education” was inspirational in a sense of learning how many types of Digital media art there is in the field, after viewing these images makes me wonder how much work and idea has been put into these pieces of art to create such objects. In this modern day era, many objects we see every day may pass as a media art, but it just depends on the viewers’ perspective. I find this era to be very big on Virtual reality due to the popularity of it in video games, and other personal entertainment.  Artists tend to focus on different fields of art and it might be because of the way the industry, forces to push artist to think financially about their work and not creatively.  Having experience in 3D art can bring many individual glories in some cases, it can be a great skill set for me to bring in to the industry, dreaming of working for Pixar or Disney would be the best accomplishment for me. Especially, in this era 3D is highly credited for its lifelike features in movies, video games, and other purposes. Taking this 3D class will boost my experience in computers and much other software in the future, printing is also one of my interests in this class, due to the fascinating things I hope to create.</p>
