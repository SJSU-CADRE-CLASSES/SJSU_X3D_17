	From the tone of the author, she is trying to narrate a story about striving for equality of gender in technological industry of art, or digital art.  Personally, I have to agree with her support of details in the essay; now, many technological companies are lacking of female employees.

	From my enjoyment of working on virtual 3D is that many gaming applications can have 3-dimensional applications. As such, console and computer gaming as well as to interior and architectural designs.

It is critical to have knowledge about virtual 3D since it is applicable in life. Even in movie productions, virtual 3D gives essential information about producing movies at 3D range.
