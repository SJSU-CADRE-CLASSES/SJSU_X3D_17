Personally, I have to agree with her support of details in the essay; now, many technological companies are lacking of female employees. Through her lens of the nudity, it stands that she desires more power for women in digital art as well as professional in interdisciplinary areas of art.

	From my enjoyment of working on virtual 3D is that many gaming applications can have 3-dimensional applications. As such, console and computer gaming as well as to interior and architectural designs. As designs progresses, architectural designs can also be modeled with virtual 3D applications, not just 2D. 3D modeling is universal, from architectural designs then to engineering. It is critical to have knowledge about virtual 3D since it is applicable in life. Even in movie productions, virtual 3D gives essential information about producing movies at 3D range.
