This article was a pretty interesting read. I did not know about the curriculum in other university and this was a good insight to how virtual 3D was taught. In my opinion, I would not mind learning both the industry production pipeline and the creative freedom in terms of virtual 3D. It's a good way to branch out if I do choose to work for an industry that has specific instructions on how things should be done. I do understand where Claudia is coming from. I do believe some university does not open their curriculum for their students to explore. I am interested in working with virtual 3D is because of the immersion factor of it. Being able to see a new world with your own eyes is different and exciting. Virtual 3D is a fairly new gateway of gaming and art. There is just so much untapped potential and I want to see if I could help it move forward, especially in a gaming aspect. I want to use the immersion that virtual 3D have and create a world that is overwhelming yet beautiful.
