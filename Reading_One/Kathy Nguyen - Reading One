<p>Claudia Hart’s talked about how society is educating students in 3D animation and modeling in a way that is like a factory without allowing much room for them to be their creative selves. Students should be able to be as creative as they want in their art, even in 3D Animation. It was very impressive how Hart came to opposing society’s industrialized education in 3D animation, especially how she went against the boys only game culture. I am also female and I enjoy playing video games on my portable console. </p>

<p>I first became interested in 3D Modeling when I watched a behind the scenes video of a movie for one of my favorite animes. There was a scene showing the creation of one of monsters in the movie being made in a 3D program that also help create the movements of the monsters for it to be animated. This helped make the monster appear 3D in the movie. I wanted to be a concept artist and maybe go into animation, so I wanted to learn 3D modeling because it could be an important skill to know in animation and even concept art. I also hope to improve my illustration skills through 3D modeling as it seems to be a form of illustration because it also shows the appearance of a design.</p>
