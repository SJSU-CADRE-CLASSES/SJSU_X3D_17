Honestly, I was a bit offended by this essay. I may be unsympathetic toward Hart’s message because of my chosen career. Yes, I plan to be just a “cog” in the “machine” she complains of. I understand that Hart wants to use the medium for her art, but she doesn’t have to insult other ways that it is used… Talk to any animator and find that there is pride and joy in our work. I certainly don’t feel like just a pawn in the “armies of the military entertainment complex.” I’m an animator because I cried when Bambi’s mom got shot. I’m an animator because I love the way Moana’s hair blows in the wind. I’m not a dead-eyed robot emotionlessly churning out animation like an assembly line… 

Hart complains of students learning techniques and tools rather than “creative potentials.” Um, excuse me? What if we applied this logic to learning traditional art forms?: 
“Students are offered classes with titles like: [Painting Perspective, Figure Drawing, etc.] These are classes named for specific technologies rather than their creative potentials.” 
See how silly that sounds. Yes, these mediums can be used for, as Hart refers, Creative Potential, but she belittles the fundamentals. You have to know the rules before you can break them. 

So I guess overall my reaction to this essay is that Hart is trying to elevate her use of the 3D technology by degrading other uses. And that doesn’t fly with me.
