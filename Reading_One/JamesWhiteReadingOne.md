Claudia’s story reminds me of a familiar story, one that occurred when I was just starting my college education. I was in a 3D design and color class in Southern California when a video game company came in, showed their recruiting video and told us about how many open jobs they had waiting for us out of college. After watching the promo video though, I knew I wasn't their target market, they were just like what Claudia described as the pedagogy of a 3D institution, feeding an industry pipeline looking for the closed off militaristic minded gamer to sit at his desk and do one specific job of the 200 they need in a production line. Just as Claudia named off in her article they wanted one guy just for texture and another for day lighting and another for shadow lighting and another for night lighting. I think part of the reason I became an artist in the first place is to have freedom of thought and creativity, not sure I could ever work for a company where I was just another “wheel in the cog”. Im glad that gaming production company came that day, after a glimpse into their company lifestyle I began looking into other majors where I could get more of a “jack of all trades” digital art education.
