I wanted to focus about how we, as humans, tend to ignore how we are trashing our oceans. I thought about how the BP oil spill in 2010 was so devastating to our oceans and I wanted to portray how it is still affecting our ocean today. 

I 3d printed 3 seashells in different colors to demonstrate this. The first seashell is printed with a clear abs plastic. This purpose of the clarity is to show how our seashells, and oceans were --undefiled, clean, and beautiful. Then after many different oil spills, the next shell has been tainted black. The shell is black on the bottom and clear on the top. The black is visible from whichever way you look at it, even from above. The third shell is completely black. It shows that it has been completely affected by the oil spill. I wanted this to maintain its aesthetic beauty to emphasize that even though we might still see the ocean as beautiful, it is still completely affected by what we do to it.
