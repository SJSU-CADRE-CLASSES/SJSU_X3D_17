<h1> Multiple Buckets <h1>

These are 3 detailed buckets and 3 eggs 3D printed. They glow in the dark as an added bonus. The story behind this is that people now a day has THE plan that will get them to success or the one route in life. "Don't put all your eggs in one basket." What if that one plan fails? Would you go broke then? I have a few friends who lost their jobs and then went from riches to rags. In life in my eyes, everyone has to have multiple plans and backup plans to life.
