What I found fascinating about this video is the feeling I got when seeing those robots in a new way.  When I had seen them before on social media, I was already impressed that they already looked so much like live organisms.  With this in mind, when Lezing started talking about the evolution of sensors and how they affect whether a machine has conciousness or not, it really made me ask, what does it mean to be alive?  Lezing also interestingly mentions how machines even in their abundance of sensors, still percieve us as data to be analyzed as opposed to how we see ourselves, which is another layer of conciousness.  I also found it noteworthy to pay attention to Google's pattern recognition systems because of this concept that humans see patterns in things that aren't actually there like shapes in the clouds while Google has somehow created something to see shapes in things, in almost the same way, except in a synthetic context.

In the end, I think the most important difference between us and machines is that we have the capacity to thing in this freeform kind of way, while machines still only collect data and their manner of thinking have to be triggered by some sort of sensory event.  But maybe the Turing test will one day reveal the mechanical champion which can actually think like a person and perhaps not even be fully aware that itself is a machine.
